# Simple-Quiz-Plugin
A simple Minecraft plugin to give a question with an answer and see who gets it right.

How to use: Get everyone you want to quiz into a minecraft server running the plugin.

To use the /quiz or /q command: Type /quiz followed by the question. The last word typed will be the answer to the question. If you want spaces in your answer, use underscores (_) and they will be interpereted as spaces.

Once you submit the question, everyone will have 15 seconds to answer in the chat. Once the time is up, the answer will be revealed and everyone who got the question right will be displayed in the chat. Everyone who got the question wrong will have their incorrect answer displayed.

(Everything is in master for some reason, oops!)
